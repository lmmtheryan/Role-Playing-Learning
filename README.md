# Role-Playing-Learning
Codes for Learning and Simulation of Role Playing Learning for Socially Concomitant Mobile Robot Navigation

Developed based on RLLAB-py2 https://github.com/openai/rllab/tree/py2

To run:
1. Replace rllab/rllab/sampler/util.py with util.py in the repository (you have to do it such the sampler returns both state and observation)
2. run TFtrpo_LDNavi_LSTM_April14.py
